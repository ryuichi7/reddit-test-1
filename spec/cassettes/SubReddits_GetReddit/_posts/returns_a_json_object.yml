        this isn''t a game to be won. Our lives are our own; I can''t compare my misery
        to yours, and you can''t compare yours to mine. That''s the horrifying beauty
        of it. They''re ours, and ours alone. \n\nAnd when we combine ourselves, god,
        I feel free of it. Just for a little bit. I can forget my pain and sorrow
        and just feel you, inside and out. Your skin is salty. You smell of spice
        and smoke. You whisper with your raspy voice against my ear, your beard scratching
        my skin, your hand on my throat. It sends shivers down my spine and through
        my toes. My own little slice of heaven. When I run my fingers down your back
        and moan in your ear so only you can hear, is it your little slice too? I
        want to know, but I''m afraid to ask. It''s such a corny question.\n\nI''ve
        been imagining what we would be like in a relationship. I know that''s not

        class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A,\nI know we&amp;#39;ve been best friends for quite
        a few months. They were quite easily the best months of my high school life.
        Being a lonely, socially anxious, introverted nerd can be difficult. You don&amp;#39;t
        make many friends, even though it seems everyone around you likes you. Making
        friends was difficult for me. Talking to girls was impossible. And to think
        that my best friend would be a girl... Whew&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first
        day you entered the class, I honestly thought you were kinda weird. I didn&amp;#39;t
        like you much. You didn&amp;#39;t talk much, and you would sit alone most
        of the time. Or sit around the group which was full of the &amp;quot;bad kids&amp;quot;.
        I remember the day when you cried in class, when you were asked about your
        friends, and how you missed them. I dunno, but that day, my view towards you
        changed. I kinda softened towards you. Plainly because I know how it feels
        staying away from your friends. I wanted to tell you that I know how it feels,
        but again, my anxiety stopped me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Months passed. We
        were just strangers. Until that computer test. I remember how I was made to
        sit in a corner, and you were made to sit right next to me. I finished quickly,
        and then you slowly asked for help. I obliged. We both aced that test. It
        was a wonderful feeling. And for the first time, I felt that someone actually
        thanked me for helping them. You were so happy that day. And then, we started
        meeting in the library, chatting sometimes. I normally hated talking to people,
        but you were different. Talking to you made me feel better in a way I can&amp;#39;t
        explain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We became good friends over Facebook. I still
        remember those late night convos we had. We started hanging around in school
        together. And then you came to know about my depression. I thought you would
        maybe stay away from me. But no, you stayed. And you helped me through it.
        I finally thought I had made a friend in high school. I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over
        the months, we grew closer. Became best friends. We had fun in the week before
        the holidays, at school. That was when I realized I actually had feelings
        for you. Whenever I saw you looking Rahul in they eyes, or standing next to
        him, I fel that tingling feeling in my stomach, tht bit of jealousy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
        holidays started. We began texting each other a lot more. It was fun. I wanted
        to tell you that I loved you, for that amazing person who you are. And oh
        god, you were so beautiful, and your smile.... It was sunshine. But I kept
        those feelings inside, due to tje fear of ruining our friendship. We grew
        closer. We even had a few fights, but in the end, we just got to know each
        other better. I told you how much you meant to me, (as a friend). We shared
        those funny little stories, and laughed. Those days were amazing. I still
        remember how you celebrated my small victories in those stupid gaming tournaments,
        even though you didn&amp;#39;t know anything about it. I remember how you
        would naughtily ask me for treats. I remember how you would get irritated
        at my silly puns, and jokes, and geekiness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember
        seeing your face for the first time in the vacations. God, you looked so pretty.
        I remember how you told me I &amp;quot;made your day&amp;quot; so many times.
        &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started thinking that maybe you like me too. How
        stupid of me. Finally, I had mustered the courage to tell you how I felt.
        I decided to tell that to you in school, because texting all those feelings
        didn&amp;#39;t quite seem right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it all shattered.
        That night, when you told me, you had a boyfriend. It left me broken inside.
        Of course I lied when I told you I was happy for you. To think that those
        beautiful eyes won&amp;#39;t be looking into mine in the future(sorry, I know
        it sounds hella creepy), it kinda broke my heart. Still, I said I was happy
        for you, that you had someone. And you believed it too (maybe)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;School
        started, and finally I got to see you. I just wantdd to run and hug you. Seeing
        you in person after such a long time, it felt great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I
        know you probably will never read this (you might, because after all, you
        joined reddit, because I suggested that you did; but the probability is next
        to zero), but I just wanted to let it out. \nIf there exists a parallel universe,
        where maybe, you like me as well, then I&amp;#39;d do anything to live in
        that world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your Best Friend :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        a few months. They were quite easily the best months of my high school life.
        Being a lonely, socially anxious, introverted nerd can be difficult. You don''t
        make many friends, even though it seems everyone around you likes you. Making
        friends was difficult for me. Talking to girls was impossible. And to think
        that my best friend would be a girl... Whew\n\nThe first day you entered the
        class, I honestly thought you were kinda weird. I didn''t like you much. You
        didn''t talk much, and you would sit alone most of the time. Or sit around
        the group which was full of the \"bad kids\". I remember the day when you
        cried in class, when you were asked about your friends, and how you missed
        them. I dunno, but that day, my view towards you changed. I kinda softened
        towards you. Plainly because I know how it feels staying away from your friends.
        I wanted to tell you that I know how it feels, but again, my anxiety stopped
        me. \n\nMonths passed. We were just strangers. Until that computer test. I
        remember how I was made to sit in a corner, and you were made to sit right
        next to me. I finished quickly, and then you slowly asked for help. I obliged.
        We both aced that test. It was a wonderful feeling. And for the first time,
        I felt that someone actually thanked me for helping them. You were so happy
        that day. And then, we started meeting in the library, chatting sometimes.
        I normally hated talking to people, but you were different. Talking to you
        made me feel better in a way I can''t explain. \n\nWe became good friends
        over Facebook. I still remember those late night convos we had. We started
        hanging around in school together. And then you came to know about my depression.
        I thought you would maybe stay away from me. But no, you stayed. And you helped
        me through it. I finally thought I had made a friend in high school. I was
        happy.\n\nOver the months, we grew closer. Became best friends. We had fun
        in the week before the holidays, at school. That was when I realized I actually
        had feelings for you. Whenever I saw you looking Rahul in they eyes, or standing
        next to him, I fel that tingling feeling in my stomach, tht bit of jealousy.
        \n\nThe holidays started. We began texting each other a lot more. It was fun.
        I wanted to tell you that I loved you, for that amazing person who you are.
        And oh god, you were so beautiful, and your smile.... It was sunshine. But
        I kept those feelings inside, due to tje fear of ruining our friendship. We
        grew closer. We even had a few fights, but in the end, we just got to know
        each other better. I told you how much you meant to me, (as a friend). We
        shared those funny little stories, and laughed. Those days were amazing. I
        still remember how you celebrated my small victories in those stupid gaming
        tournaments, even though you didn''t know anything about it. I remember how
        you would naughtily ask me for treats. I remember how you would get irritated
        at my silly puns, and jokes, and geekiness\n\nI remember seeing your face
        for the first time in the vacations. God, you looked so pretty. I remember
        how you told me I \"made your day\" so many times. \n\nI started thinking
        that maybe you like me too. How stupid of me. Finally, I had mustered the
        courage to tell you how I felt. I decided to tell that to you in school, because
        texting all those feelings didn''t quite seem right. \n\nAnd then it all shattered.
        That night, when you told me, you had a boyfriend. It left me broken inside.
        Of course I lied when I told you I was happy for you. To think that those
        beautiful eyes won''t be looking into mine in the future(sorry, I know it
        sounds hella creepy), it kinda broke my heart. Still, I said I was happy for
        you, that you had someone. And you believed it too (maybe)\n\nSchool started,
        and finally I got to see you. I just wantdd to run and hug you. Seeing you
        in person after such a long time, it felt great. \n\n\nI know you probably
        will never read this (you might, because after all, you joined reddit, because
        I suggested that you did; but the probability is next to zero), but I just
        wanted to let it out. \nIf there exists a parallel universe, where maybe,
        you like me as well, then I''d do anything to live in that world\n\nYour Best
        Friend :)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media":

        and that we almost haven\u2019t talked in that time, it might be weird to
        receive this now, but I have wanted to tell you this for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First
        of all, I think you\u2019re great, and I really like you. You\u2019re funny
        and smart, and it\u2019s always fun when you\u2019re around. When we were
        hanging out you also seemed to be somewhat interested in me and who I was.
        This might be how you are with everyone, but to me it was new, I don\u2019t
        get those kind of questions a lot. Still, I never thought you could be interested
        in me in a romantic way, you were good at the things where I fall short. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You
        seem fearless, and you do the things you want to do, without much thought
        about what others might think. It seems like your life is full of fun people
        and events, while I am just a guy that doesn\u2019t take too much space, a
        guy you don\u2019t really notice, and I couldn\u2019t imagine the possibility
        of me fitting into your life. I felt, and feel, like I am too boring for you,
        but I really wish that it weren\u2019t that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This
        is also the reason for me asking you out right before we were both going away.
        Since we were going away, I knew it would amount to nothing, and therefore
        I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with all this. It was just my way of letting
        you know that I liked you. I thought it might have been a nice thing for you
        to know that I, someone that maybe knew you a different way than other guys,
        really liked you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we are back in the same
        city, my feelings are coming back stronger, and I think about you all the
        time. I really want to let you know how I feel, but I have never had a close
        relationship with anyone, and I don\u2019t know where to begin. Friends I
        have had for 15 years have told me that it\u2019s awkward to be with me alone,
        and I can\u2019t blame them, I know I can be awkward, and make things awkward.
        I imagine this only being worse if it was with you, and I can\u2019t understand
        how we could ever get to a point where things would be natural and fun. With
        all the outgoing, fun people you have around you, I can\u2019t imagine you
        being interested in anything like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I was
        never really sure if you liked me or if you spent time with me to be nice
        to someone that wasn\u2019t the best at making friends. So all this might
        be weird to receive from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t expect a response
