        you. There would have been so, so much to say.\n\nMaybe a stupid part of me
        is hoping that you''ll see this, somehow.\n\nI don''t even know where you
        are.\n\nI just wish it was with me.\n\nAnd if you''re better somewhere, then
        I''m sorry. I will be going before you. I want you to know. I just want you
        here again,\n\nfor I have nothing\n\nand I am exhausted without you,\n\nwherever
        you may be,\n\nand i just want you to tell me something good again.", "likes":
